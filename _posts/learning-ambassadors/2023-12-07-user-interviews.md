# Intro to Conducting User Interviews

## Overview
According to the Interaction Design Foundation, **"User research is the methodic study of target users — including their needs and pain points — so designers have the sharpest possible insights to work with to make the best designs."**

User research is an integral part of the design process, not only in defining who the users are but also in understanding the differences between what they want and what they need. Various research methods are employed during this discovery phase, including:

1. Stakeholder Interviews
2. Subject matter expert interviews
3. User and customer interviews
4. Contextual interviews (ethnographic studies)
5. Diary studies
6. Focus groups

In this section, we will delve deeper into number 3, user and customer interviews.

## Understanding the User
Firstly, it is important to distinguish between the user and the customer. While many people group these terms, there is a nuanced difference between the two. Customers are the decision-makers, paying the bill, but not necessarily the end users. For successful research, understanding the needs of both the customer and the user is crucial.

Secondly, consider the persona hypothesis. Who might use this product? How might their needs and behaviors vary? What types of environments might this product be used in? Interviewing a variety of people helps gain different perspectives.

## Interview Techniques
After gaining a clearer understanding of users and customers, it is time to conduct the interview. Crucially, ask open-ended questions to guide the user and let them tell their story, avoiding leading questions. Make the interview a conversation, not an interrogation, as getting a story from the user is more informative than getting statements.

While interview questions should be tailored to the product or service, some general essential topics include:

- **Activities:** Key tasks, their importance, end goals, and frequency.
- **Frustrations:** Likes, dislikes, and understanding pain points.
- **Skills:** Relevant knowledge and skill sets, areas of struggle.
- **Logistics:** Consistent questions, asking follow-ups, and obtaining permission for recording sessions.

Consider this case: if conducting an interview for a new app helping tourists explore a location, questions could include "walk me through the steps you take when you arrive in a new vacation area" or "tell me about your experience using vacation planning apps/websites."

After gathering both quantitative and qualitative data from user interviews, transition to analysis, creating user personas, and subsequently, journey maps.
