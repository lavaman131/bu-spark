## Why should you do a personal project?

       If you’re majoring in CS, DS, CE, or any other tech discipline, and plan on going into a computer science-related field, you probably know how competitive the market is. You might also know how competitive internship opportunities are. This has left a lot of us wondering; what can I do to boost my resume for work and internships?

       This is where a “personal project” comes in. A personal project can be a lot of things: a little program that computes the result of a formula based on inputs given by a user, a tiny display that shows your Instagram follower count, or even a calculator app or website. Your project doesn’t have to be perfect or complicated, and it doesn’t have to take days of your time; if you are a freshman or a sophomore, your personal project should be a reflection of what you’ve learned in your courses so far. If you’ve only learned Python, that’s okay! Even CS111 gives you enough content to begin working on a personal project. You can showcase what you’ve learned through a program that gives a user an introduction based on some inputs, or a tic-tac-toe game!

       Personal projects can make up for a lack of experience on your resume. Realistically, it’s crazy to expect applicants for intern positions to have prior work experience in CS as students, but with such a big, competitive applicant pool, some of them *****will***** have that. But these positions or experiences are hard to get, and not as accessible for all students, which is why you might want to focus on a personal project. This is an opportunity to show possible employers what things you’re interested in, what you have extra experience with, and overall, just get a better idea of you as an applicant.

       With all this being said, you don’t *need* a reason to do a personal project. If you have an idea you’re dying to carry out, then just start planning it! It’s never a bad idea to do a personal project for fun or to improve your skills.

## When should you start a personal project?

       Really, this is entirely up to you, what you have time for, what resume boosters you already have, and when you need a working resume by. In a perfect world, you could be doing a bunch of projects for a bunch of different concepts you learn throughout your college career to deepen your understanding of all of them. However, if we’re being realistic, between your course load, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), applications, mental health, possibly working, and basic necessities, we all have to ration our time. So, this section is written purely from a career standpoint.

       If you’re a freshman, and you plan to apply to internship positions for the following summer, it might be best to build up a couple of simple projects.  It might seem awkward to display simple projects but remember; you *just* started learning. If an employer is looking at your projects, they have already looked at your resume, and they already have an idea of where you’re at. The same things apply to a sophomore.

       If you are a little farther into your CS degree, and you haven’t even thought about personal projects — don’t fret! You still have time. At this point, you have (hopefully) learned a lot more content, and you can develop an even more interesting and unique idea. If you already have a simple project or two under your belt, you can always find new ways to improve upon it.

## On-campus resources for help with personal projects!

       What can you do if you’re lost on where to start, or if you’ve hit a wall? There are a couple of resources on campus that you can go to if you’re running into issues with your personal projects:

![Syntax and Snax](/assets/posts/2023-12-07-personal-projects/sns.png)

### Sign up for a Spark! consultation!

### Syntax and Snax!

Syntax and Snax, held in the Spark! Space (CDS, second floor) is an event held twice a week where students can come by for help on their personal projects. If you’re not sure what to do, or even what questions to ask, this is the perfect place to start. We have several people you can speak with who all have an in-depth understanding of computer science. You can ask them questions, or for guidance, or for a general idea of how hard a prospective project might be. We also have snacks for any students who attend, as long as they are currently working on something or asking questions.

## How to start on a personal project?

       First of all, try not to get in your own head. Creating something new from scratch can be intimidating, especially if you aren’t sure how to execute some aspects of your project. That being said, you might have to research some things in order to make a working project. Sometimes, you’ll have an idea that you don’t entirely know how to execute. This doesn’t mean you can’t do it. So much of software developing is looking things up, visiting [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), watching YouTube videos, etc., so don’t be afraid to start something that requires a lot of that.

       For planning and organization, you can use websites like [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and other resources like these.

## Ideas for beginner projects.

       It might be difficult to think of ideas when you’re a beginner. You might have to watch a few YouTube tutorials too. REMEMBER: you don’t NEED a UI. Here’s just a small list to get you brainstorming:

- Simple games (hangman, tic-tac-toe, rock paper scissors).
- Random number generator with settings (must be odd/even, must be between x and y, must be a prime number, must be divisible by 3, etc.).
- Automation (deleting files in downloaded folder after x days).
- Web scraping (not as hard as you might think — check out this video! [Beginners Guide To Web Scraping with Python - All You Need To Know](https://youtu.be/QhD015WUMxE?feature=shared)
- A program that solves math problems.
- A program that creates, deletes, or manipulates files.

## How to improve on your projects when you’re no longer a beginner?

       Once you get a little farther into your classes and start to feel more confident with coding and researching how to code, here a couple general ways to improve your projects.

- Add a UI, if it doesn’t have one already.
- Add accessibility settings (speech to text, text to speech, font size, light/dark mode, etc.).
- Add an “AI” capability.
- Add log-in capability.

## APIs

APIs are a powerful tool that can enhance your personal projects. They allow you to integrate external data and functionality, making your projects even more dynamic and interactive. There are countless APIs available for different purposes, such as weather data, social media integration, and image recognition. Incorporating an API into your project can take it to the next level and provide a real-world application for your skills. Consider making a Spotify app! They have a very beginner friendly API and documentation!

## Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and other little pieces of tech.

       If you need a way for your project to be constantly running, want to create a robotics type project, or need to connect some hardware, try a Raspberry Pi or Arduino. A Raspberry Pi is a SMALL computer with BIG functionality that you can plug I/O devices into, while an Arduino is a ready-made circuit board. There are plenty of online resources for getting started with these pieces of tech; here are some videos to get you started:
